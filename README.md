# FreeCodeCamp Backend Microservice Projects

This is a repository containing my project work on the [FreeCodeCamp Backend and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) course, which are 5 necessary microservices which need to be implemented before receiving their certification.

## What I Learned (so far)
- Using npm to install, update and manage project dependencies
- Using Express JS + Node to build a backend server with a RESTful API capable of handling requests and serving content to the end user
- Connecting the backend server to **MongoDB** via mongoose library to manage long-term data, including addition, modification, retrieval and deletion. 

## How to Use
This repository is meant to be more of a reference of what I have done, and not to be copied line for line to complete the tasks. To use, simply start node in any of the folders to have the service running locally. I used Replit for coding and submission, so there is no `.env` file for your secrets such as your MongoDB credentials.
